# Roadmap: Date Display App

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a working React application that displays the current date. Phase 1 establishes the development environment with Vite tooling. Phase 2 implements the date display feature with clean, minimal styling. The project demonstrates the GSD workflow on a simple, focused application.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Project Setup** - Initialize React app with Vite and verify build tools
- [ ] **Phase 2: Date Display** - Implement date display with minimal styling
