## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting v1.4 work:

- [v1.2]: Open-Meteo API chosen (no key required, 10k req/day free) — establishes weather data source
- [v1.2]: Three-state async pattern (loading + error + data) — provides pattern for city switching UX
- [v1.2]: Flexbox header layout — provides location for settings icon placement
- [v1.0]: src/components/ directory structure — guides where settings modal components live
