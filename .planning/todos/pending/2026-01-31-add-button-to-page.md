## Problem

Future enhancement: Need to add an interactive button element to the application. Currently the app only displays the date with no interactive elements.

Button purpose and functionality not yet specified - placeholder for future feature work.

## Solution

TBD - need to determine:
- Button purpose (what action it triggers)
- Button placement (below date, sidebar, etc.)
- Button styling (match current minimal aesthetic)
- Event handler implementation
