<current_state>
Phase 6 planning complete. All research, planning, and verification finished successfully. Ready to execute 06-01-PLAN.md.

**Status:** Planning phase complete, execution ready to start
**Next step:** Run `/gsd:execute-phase 6` to begin implementation
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Planning Activities

- ✓ Phase 6 research completed (06-RESEARCH.md)
  - CSS Flexbox patterns for header layout documented
  - Component composition approach verified
  - Common pitfalls identified (forgetting display: flex, text overflow)

- ✓ Plan created (06-01-PLAN.md)
  - Task 1: Create WeatherWidget placeholder with "Geneva" label
  - Task 2: Create Header component, integrate in App, add CSS flexbox layout
  - 4 files to modify: WeatherWidget.tsx, Header.tsx, App.tsx, App.css

- ✓ Plan verified by gsd-plan-checker
  - All 5 requirements covered (LAY-01 through LAY-04, WTH-04)
  - Task completeness validated
  - Dependencies verified (none - single wave)
  - Verification criteria confirmed
</completed_work>

## Execution Phase

**Plan 06-01** (Wave 1, autonomous):

- [ ] Task 1: Create WeatherWidget.tsx placeholder
  - Simple functional component
  - Displays "Geneva" location label
  - Uses className "weather-widget" for styling

- [ ] Task 2: Create Header component and integrate
  - Header.tsx: Compose DateDisplay and WeatherWidget with flexbox
  - App.tsx: Use Header instead of DateDisplay directly
  - App.css: Add flexbox styles (.header with space-between layout)
  - Remove text-align: center from .date-display

**Verification after execution:**
- npm run build succeeds
- Date appears on left, "Geneva" on right
- Horizontal flexbox alignment working
- Button color change still works
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

## Planning Decisions

- **Component structure**: Create dedicated Header component following single responsibility principle (composing DateDisplay + WeatherWidget) rather than directly in App
  - Rationale: Cleaner separation, matches research recommendations

- **Layout approach**: CSS Flexbox with `justify-content: space-between`
  - Rationale: Standard pattern for left/right header layout, no libraries needed

- **Placeholder simplicity**: WeatherWidget shows only "Geneva" label in Phase 6
  - Rationale: Keep focused on layout; full weather implementation is Phase 7

- **Wave structure**: Single wave (no dependencies)
  - Rationale: Both tasks can execute together, no inter-task dependencies
</decisions_made>

## Known Concerns

None - Switched to Open-Meteo API (no authentication required).

Previous concerns about OpenWeatherMap API key setup and exposure eliminated.

## Mental Model

**What we're building:** Transform the current single-column layout (date, button) into a header layout with date on left and weather placeholder on right. This sets up the visual structure for Phase 7's weather API integration.

**Architecture approach:**
1. Create WeatherWidget as a simple placeholder (just shows "Geneva")
2. Create Header component that uses CSS Flexbox to arrange DateDisplay (existing) and WeatherWidget (new) horizontally
3. Update App.tsx to use Header instead of DateDisplay directly
4. Add CSS for flexbox layout (space-between for left/right alignment)

**Key insight from research:** Use `justify-content: space-between` on the header container to push date left and weather right. The `gap` property handles spacing cleanly without manual margins.

**What stays the same:** Button below header, color change functionality, DateDisplay component itself (just repositioned by parent flexbox).

**Execution confidence:** High - straightforward React component composition + standard CSS Flexbox patterns. Research showed no edge cases or library dependencies needed.

When resuming, start with:

```
/gsd:execute-phase 6
```

This will spawn gsd-executor agent to run 06-01-PLAN.md. The plan is autonomous and verified, so execution should be straightforward.

**Expected outcome:** Header layout working with date left, "Geneva" right, button centered below. Takes ~1 minute based on velocity trends.

**If issues arise:** Check that:
- DateDisplay component exists and accepts color prop (from Phase 2)
- App.tsx still has color state and Button component (from Phases 3-4)
- npm run dev works after changes
