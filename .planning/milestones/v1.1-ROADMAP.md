# Milestone v1.1: Interactive Button

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-31
**Phases:** 3-4
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Add interactive button that changes date color randomly. This milestone demonstrates React state management, event handling, and component prop patterns with TypeScript.

## Phases

### Phase 3: Button UI

**Goal**: User can see a styled button on the page
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 03-01: Create Button component with green styling, integrate below DateDisplay

**Details:**

Created reusable Button component with green background (#22c55e, Tailwind green-500) centered below the existing DateDisplay component. Component follows established functional component pattern and is ready for click handler integration in Phase 4.

**Requirements:** BTN-01, BTN-02, BTN-03

**Success Criteria:**
1. Green button with "Click me" text is visible on page
2. Button is centered horizontally on page
3. Button is positioned below the date display

**Files created:**
- src/components/Button.tsx

**Files modified:**
- src/App.tsx
- src/App.css

**Commits:** 34ff6e4, f06a259

### Phase 4: Interactive Color Change

**Goal**: User can click button to change date color
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 04-01: Wire button click to date color change using React state

**Details:**

Implemented full interactive color-changing functionality using React's useState hook. Button clicks trigger random hex color generation (#RRGGBB format) which updates the date text color via inline styles. State is managed in App.tsx with props flowing down to DateDisplay and Button components. All components properly typed with TypeScript interfaces.

**Requirements:** INT-01, INT-02, INT-03

**Success Criteria:**
1. Button responds visibly to click events
2. Date text color changes when button is clicked
3. Each click produces a different random color

**Files modified:**
- src/App.tsx (added useState, color generator, click handler)
- src/components/DateDisplay.tsx (added color prop)
- src/components/Button.tsx (added onClick prop)

**Commits:** 68c8538, f0055d9

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Use Tailwind green-500 (#22c55e) for button color (professional appearance)
- Use black (#000000) as initial date color (seamless pre-interaction UX)
- Generate colors in hex format (#RRGGBB) (universal browser support)
- Apply colors via inline styles (appropriate for dynamic runtime values)
- Lift state up to App.tsx (single source of truth for shared state)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Tasks 1 and 2 in Phase 4 were tightly coupled due to TypeScript type checking - completed both together but maintained atomic commits per task
- Established clear component prop patterns for future feature additions

**Issues Deferred:**

- Color history tracking (not needed for v1.1 basic interaction)
- Color persistence across page refresh (stateless interaction sufficient)
- Animation effects on color change (focus on core functionality first)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - all code follows established patterns and best practices.

**Patterns Established:**

- State management in parent component (App.tsx)
- Props flow down from parent to children
- Event handlers passed as props with 'on' prefix convention
- TypeScript prop types defined for all components
- Inline styles for dynamic values, CSS classes for static styles
