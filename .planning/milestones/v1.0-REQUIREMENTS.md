# Requirements: Date Display App

**Defined:** 2026-01-31
**Core Value:** A working React app that successfully demonstrates the GSD workflow from initialization through execution, with clean architecture that makes adding features straightforward.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Setup

- [x] **SETUP-01**: React app initialized with Vite — ✓ Validated (Phase 1)
- [x] **SETUP-02**: Development server runs locally — ✓ Validated (Phase 1)
- [x] **SETUP-03**: Project can build for production — ✓ Validated (Phase 1)

### Display

- [x] **DISP-01**: Current date displays at top of page — ✓ Validated (Phase 2)
- [x] **DISP-02**: Date updates when page loads — ✓ Validated (Phase 2)
- [x] **DISP-03**: Clean, minimal styling applied — ✓ Validated (Phase 2)

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

(To be determined based on GSD experiment outcomes)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Complex UI frameworks or design systems | Keep v1 simple, focus on GSD workflow testing |
| Backend server or API | Client-side only for now, not needed for date display |
| Database or persistence | No data to persist in v1 |
| Multiple pages or routing | Single page sufficient for v1 |
| Testing infrastructure | Can add later if project expands |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| SETUP-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| SETUP-02 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| SETUP-03 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| DISP-01 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| DISP-02 | Phase 2 | Complete |
