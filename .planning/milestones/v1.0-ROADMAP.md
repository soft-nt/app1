# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-31
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a working React application that displays the current date. Phase 1 establishes the development environment with Vite tooling. Phase 2 implements the date display feature with clean, minimal styling. The project demonstrates the GSD workflow on a simple, focused application.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup

**Goal**: Development environment is ready
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: SETUP-01, SETUP-02, SETUP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can run `npm run dev` and see app in browser
  2. User can run `npm run build` without errors
  3. Project structure follows standard Vite conventions
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Scaffold Vite+React+TS project and verify dev/build tools

**Details:**
- Scaffolded complete React 19.2 application using official Vite 7.3.1 react-ts template
- Installed 225 dependencies with zero vulnerabilities
- Verified development server starts and serves React app with HMR
- Confirmed production build completes successfully with optimized bundles

### Phase 2: Date Display

**Goal**: User sees current date on the page
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: DISP-01, DISP-02, DISP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Current date is visible at top of page when app loads
  2. Date format is clear and readable
  3. Styling is clean and minimal
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Implement date display feature with clean styling

**Details:**
- Created DateDisplay component using native Intl.DateTimeFormat API
- Integrated component into App with clean, minimal centered styling
- Removed Vite template demo content for clean starting point
- Established component directory structure pattern (src/components/)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Used Vite 7.3.1 with react-ts template (official React recommendation)
- Applied zero configuration modifications to maintain production-ready defaults
- Used Intl.DateTimeFormat for locale-aware date formatting (native API, zero dependencies)
- Established src/components/ directory for component organization

**Issues Resolved:**
- Worked around non-empty directory prompt during Vite scaffolding (used temp directory approach)
- Dev server port conflict automatically resolved by Vite (used port 5174 instead of 5173)

**Issues Deferred:**
None - all planned work completed successfully.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None - used production-ready defaults throughout.
