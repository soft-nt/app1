## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

(To be determined based on future exploration)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Color picker UI | Keep it simple - random only for v1.1 |
| Color history/undo | Not needed for basic interaction demo |
| Animation effects | Focus on core functionality first |
| Multiple buttons | Single button sufficient for v1.1 |
| Persist color across refresh | Stateless interaction is fine for demo |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| BTN-01 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| BTN-02 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| BTN-03 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| INT-01 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| INT-02 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| INT-03 | Phase 4 | Complete |
