# Requirements: Date Display App

**Defined:** 2026-01-31
**Core Value:** A working React app that successfully demonstrates the GSD workflow from initialization through execution, with clean architecture that makes adding features straightforward.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.1 Interactive Button milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Button

- [ ] **BTN-01**: Green button with "Click me" text displays on page
- [ ] **BTN-02**: Button is centered horizontally on page
- [ ] **BTN-03**: Button is positioned in middle of page (below date)

### Interaction

- [ ] **INT-01**: Button responds to click events
- [ ] **INT-02**: Random color is generated on each click
- [ ] **INT-03**: Date text color updates to the random color when button clicked

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

(To be determined based on future exploration)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Color picker UI | Keep it simple - random only for v1.1 |
| Color history/undo | Not needed for basic interaction demo |
| Animation effects | Focus on core functionality first |
| Multiple buttons | Single button sufficient for v1.1 |
| Persist color across refresh | Stateless interaction is fine for demo |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| BTN-01 | TBD | Pending |
| BTN-02 | TBD | Pending |
| BTN-03 | TBD | Pending |
| INT-01 | TBD | Pending |
| INT-02 | TBD | Pending |
| INT-03 | TBD | Pending |
