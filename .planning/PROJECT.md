# Date Display App

## What This Is

A React web application that displays the current date at the top of the page. Built as an experiment to explore the GSD workflow and demonstrate how the system handles planning, execution, and iteration on a simple project.

## Core Value

A working React app that successfully demonstrates the GSD workflow from initialization through execution, with clean architecture that makes adding features straightforward.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Display current date at top of page
- [ ] React app with modern tooling (Vite or Create React App)
- [ ] Clean, minimal UI
- [ ] Development server that runs locally

### Out of Scope

- Complex UI frameworks or design systems — keep it simple for v1
- Backend server or API — client-side only for now
- Database or persistence — not needed yet
- Multiple pages or routing — single page for v1
- Testing infrastructure — can add later if needed

## Context

This is an experimental project to test and learn the GSD workflow. The goal is to see how GSD handles the full lifecycle:
- How it breaks down even simple projects
- How planning and execution work
- How iteration and feature additions are managed

The date display is intentionally minimal - a working proof of concept that can grow based on what's learned from the GSD process.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: React — requested by user
- **Scope**: Keep v1 minimal — priority is testing GSD, not building complex features
- **Timeline**: None — this is exploratory

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| React for framework | User preference, widely supported, good for experiments | — Pending |
| Minimal v1 scope | Focus on GSD workflow learning, not feature complexity | — Pending |
